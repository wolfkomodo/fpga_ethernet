# fpga_ethernet
Ethernet stack for interfacing in RMII with Ethernet PHY of Nexys4 DDR FPGA. This work was done as part of a larger project, always_comm, which is a was an FPGA-based video streaming device. Because that code is under the MIT GitHub enterprise, I'm moving the Ethernet stack that I independently built to a public repo.
